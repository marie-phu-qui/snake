# Snake,
## a snake game in React.js

It is hard to come back to coding after a wee while (2 months for myself, between travel and off grid holidays).
The imposter syndrom kicks in !
This is the first of a sequence of easy to reach on your own project that I setted for myself.
I love coding, but what I love the most about it is coding in groups/pair. Having a coding buddy makes the whole creation process a bigger and better pumped up time and victories are celebrated more.

Knowing that, I do need to keep my coding skills going, as well as my victory strech !
I have been setting many projects that I want to create, but also would love to create with people. This one is a very simple, user interractive starter game.

## Goals

- Finish a project from A to Z with a short deadline.

- Have a board screen

- Have a moving snake on user input (W, A, S, D keys)

- Have a win/ lose end

- Have a start button

- Have a score view
